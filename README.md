# Recorder technical task

To run the project, after cloning the repo, run `npm i` to install all dependencies, and run `npm start` to spin up the development server, then visit `localhost:3000` in a browser to view the app.

My first step in tackling this task was to put pen to paper and sketch out the app as described. After mocking up the layout for visual reference, as described below, I bootstrapped the project with `npx create-react-app` using all default settings without any of the optional project templates. I then began stripping the default generated content, and adding the basic structure of the app. After having the basic structure built out, I began adding the functionalities following through the task prompt to implement each of the requested features.

As for critiques, the buttons still don't sync perfectly, and it's possible to get the play button out of sync with its active state. I also would have liked to implement a progress bar beside the record/playback timers, and sync its' selection with the value of the `playTime` state, but I wanted to keep the dependencies to a minimum for the task, and after some research, decided it would be best to focus on specs rather than get rabbit holed on a stretch goal.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
